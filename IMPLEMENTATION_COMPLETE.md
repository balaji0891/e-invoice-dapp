### 4. **Smart Contract Security** ✅
- Deployed to Sepolia: `0x2F23CD241EeB31c87BE0822fEbEDFc9FA7459454`
- Payment validation: `msg.value == invoice.amountInWei`
- Prevents underpayment attacks
- Access control for encrypted amounts
- Event emissions for transparency

## 📋 ONE FINAL STEP REQUIRED

Update your Replit Secret `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to the new secure contract:

**New Contract Address**: `0x2F23CD241EeB31c87BE0822fEbEDFc9FA7459454`

### How to Update:
1. Go to Replit Secrets (Tools → Secrets)
2. Find `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
3. Replace with: `0x2F23CD241EeB31c87BE0822fEbEDFc9FA7459454`
4. Save and restart the app

6. ✅ Cancel pending invoices
7. ✅ Receive ETH payment when recipient pays

### Invoice Recipient
1. ✅ Connect wallet with MetaMask
2. ✅ View received invoices
3. ✅ Decrypt and view invoice amounts
4. ✅ Click "Pay Invoice" button
5. ✅ See exact required payment amount in ETH
6. ✅ Confirm payment - sends ETH to creator's wallet
7. ✅ Invoice automatically marked as "Paid"

---

## 💰 How Payment Works

1. **Recipient clicks "Pay Invoice"**
   - System displays exact payment amount required
   - Amount is calculated from on-chain data (no manual entry)

2. **Recipient confirms payment**
   - MetaMask opens with pre-filled transaction
   - Exact ETH amount shown
   - Recipient approves transaction

3. **Smart contract validates**
   - Checks `msg.value == invoice.amountInWei`
   - If match: transfers ETH to creator, marks invoice paid
   - If mismatch: transaction reverts (security protection)

4. **Invoice updated**
   - Status changes to "Paid"
   - Both parties see real-time update
   - Transaction recorded on Sepolia blockchain

---

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Exact Payment Matching** - Recipients must pay exact amount, no underpayment possible
✅ **FHE Encryption** - Amounts encrypted on-chain, only sender/recipient can decrypt
✅ **Access Control** - Only invoice parties can view encrypted amounts
✅ **Precision-Safe** - Uses Wei values to prevent rounding errors
✅ **Event Emissions** - All actions logged on blockchain
