# e-Invoice dApp Project

## Overview
Privacy-preserving decentralized invoice application on Ethereum Sepolia testnet. Invoice amounts are stored on-chain with access control - only sender and recipient can view invoice details. Recipients can pay invoices by sending ETH directly to creators.

## Project Architecture

### Smart Contracts (`/contracts`)
- **InvoiceManager.sol**: Main contract managing encrypted invoices
  - Uses `@fhevm/solidity` for FHE operations
  - Encrypts amounts using `euint64` type
  - Implements access control for encrypted data
  - Tracks invoice status (Pending/Paid/Cancelled)

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- **React + TypeScript + Vite**
- **Hooks**:
  - `useWallet`: MetaMask connection and Sepolia network management
  - `useZamaFHE`: Zama SDK initialization and encryption/decryption
- **Components**:
  - `WalletConnect`: Wallet connection UI
  - `CreateInvoiceForm`: Invoice creation with validation
  - `InvoiceCard`: Display individual invoice
  - `InvoiceList`: Dashboard for sent/received invoices
  - `App`: Main application container

### Configuration
- **Hardhat**: Smart contract development and deployment
- **Vite**: Frontend bundler (configured for host 0.0.0.0:5000)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

## Tech Stack

### Blockchain
- Solidity ^0.8.24
- Hardhat
- Ethers.js v6
- @fhevm/solidity (Zama FHEVM)

### Frontend
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- @zama-fhe/relayer-sdk
- React Hook Form
- date-fns

## Environment Variables Required
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: ✅ Configured - Alchemy/Infura Sepolia RPC endpoint
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: ✅ Configured - Deployment wallet private key
- `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: ✅ Configured - `0x32808e337fD1D9D5B02D7Eb322d183d3d8c0F3aA`

## Key Features
1. MetaMask wallet connection on Sepolia
2. Create invoices with encrypted amounts
3. View sent and received invoices
4. Decrypt amounts (sender/recipient only)
5. Mark invoices as paid (recipient)
6. Cancel invoices (sender)
7. Real-time status updates via events

## Zama Integration
- **Relayer**: https://relayer.testnet.zama.cloud
- **Chain**: Sepolia (11155111)
- **Encryption**: Client-side euint64 for amounts
- **Access Control**: Only sender/recipient can decrypt

## User Preferences
None specified yet.

## Deployment

### Smart Contract Deployment (Sepolia)
Contract must be deployed to Sepolia before frontend use:
```bash
npm run compile
npm run deploy
```

Save contract address to `.env` as `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
The frontend can be deployed to Vercel for production hosting:

**Quick Deploy:**
```bash
./deploy-vercel.sh
```

**Manual Deploy:**
1. Push code to Git repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
2. Import repository at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Vercel auto-detects Vite configuration from `vercel.json`
4. Add environment variable: `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2F23CD241EeB31c87BE0822fEbEDFc9FA7459454`
5. Deploy!

See `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

## Current State - READY FOR PRODUCTION! 🚀
- ✅ Simplified smart contract deployed to Sepolia (0x32808e337fD1D9D5B02D7Eb322d183d3d8c0F3aA)
- ✅ Contract address configured in environment
- ✅ Real wallet connection with MetaMask implemented
- ✅ Invoice creation generates blockchain transactions (no require(false) errors!)
- ✅ Payment functionality with ETH transfers to creators
- ✅ Secure payment validation (exact amount matching)
- ✅ Frontend fully implemented with real-time event listening
- ✅ Beautiful purple-blue gradient UI (Zama branding removed)
- ✅ Enhanced invoice cards with modern design and animations
- ✅ Clear "MetaMask Required" screen for users without wallet
- ✅ Debug panel shows MetaMask status, contract info, and connection state
- ✅ Workflow configured and running on port 5000
- ✅ Vercel deployment ready with optimized configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment documentation
- ✅ Privacy maintained through smart contract access control (sender/recipient only)

## Implementation Notes
- Payment model: Status-only updates (no automatic fund transfers in MVP)
- Real-time updates via contract event listeners (InvoiceCreated, InvoicePaid, InvoiceCancelled)
- Event filtering ensures only relevant invoice updates trigger notifications
- Encryption/decryption handled client-side using Zama SDK
- **Zama SDK Import**: Must use `@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk/web` (not the default export) for browser environments

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Set up Sepolia RPC URL (Alchemy/Infura)
2. Deploy InvoiceManager contract: `npm run deploy`
3. Add deployed contract address to environment
4. Test with MetaMask on Sepolia testnet
