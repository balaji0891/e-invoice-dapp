### **Step 2: Get Testnet ETH** ⏱️ 1-2 minutes

You need ~0.05 ETH for deployment (it's free testnet ETH):

**Best Faucets:**
1. **Alchemy Faucet**: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
2. **Sepolia Faucet**: https://sepoliafaucet.com/

**How to get it:**

2. Copy your wallet address
3. Visit any faucet above → Paste address → Request ETH
4. Wait ~30 seconds for ETH to arrive

---

### **Step 3: Add Secrets to Replit** ⏱️ 2 minutes

🔒 **IMPORTANT**: Use Replit Secrets (not .env file) for security!

**In Replit:**

1. **Open Secrets Panel**:
   - Look in the left sidebar under "Tools"
   - Click the **🔒 lock icon** labeled "Secrets"

2. **Add Secret #1 - RPC URL**:
   - **Key**: `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`
   - **Value**: Paste your Alchemy/Infura URL
   - Click "Add Secret"

3. **Add Secret #2 - Private Key**:
   - **In MetaMask**: 
     - Click the 3 dots → Account Details
     - Click "Show Private Key"
     - Enter password → Copy the key
   - **In Replit Secrets**:
     - **Key**: `PRIVATE_KEY`
     - **Value**: Paste your private key (remove `0x` prefix if present)
     - Click "Add Secret"

4. **Add Secret #3 - Contract Address** (empty for now):
   - **Key**: `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
   - **Value**: Leave blank
   - Click "Add Secret"

---

### **Step 4: Deploy Smart Contract** ⏱️ 1-2 minutes

**In the Replit Shell:**

```bash
# Compile the contract
npm run compile

# Deploy to Sepolia
npm run deploy
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Deploying InvoiceManager contract to Sepolia...
Deploying with account: 0xYourAddress
Account balance: 0.05 ETH
InvoiceManager deployed to: 0x1234567890abcdef...

✅ Deployment complete!
Save this address in your .env file as:
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1234567890abcdef...
```

**Copy the contract address!** (the long `0x...` address)

---

### **Step 5: Update Contract Address in Secrets** ⏱️ 30 seconds

1. Go back to **Replit Secrets** panel
2. Find `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
3. Click "Edit" → Paste your contract address
4. Click "Save"

---

### **Step 6: Restart the App** ⏱️ 30 seconds

The app will automatically restart and switch from **Demo Mode** to **Production Mode**!

```bash
# The workflow restarts automatically, or manually:
npm run dev
```

**You'll know it worked when:**
- ✅ The "DEMO MODE" badge disappears from the header
- ✅ "Connect Wallet" button appears
- ✅ App is now connected to real blockchain!

## 🌐 Publishing Your App (Making it Publicly Accessible)

### **Option 1: Replit Deployment** (Easiest)

Your app is already configured for Replit deployment!

**To Publish:**
1. Click the **"Deploy"** button at the top of Replit
2. Choose your deployment settings
3. Click "Deploy" 
4. You'll get a public URL like: `https://your-app.repl.co`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Custom domain support (paid plans)
- ✅ Auto-scaling
- ✅ Environment secrets included

---

### **Option 2: Current Replit Dev URL**

Your app is already accessible at your Replit dev URL!

**Current URL:**
- Open the "Webview" tab in Replit
- Copy the URL (format: `https://[project-id].repl.co`)
- Share this URL - it's publicly accessible while your Repl is running!

**Note**: Dev URL requires the Repl to be running. For 24/7 uptime, use Replit Deployment.
